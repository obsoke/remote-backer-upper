REMOTE-BACKER-UPPER

This is a simple script I wrote in order to back up the files and
databases on my VPS. 

This script has only been tested with Ruby 1.9.3.

REQUIREMENTS:
- net/ssh gem
- net/scp gem

USAGE:
1) Clone repo or download it as an archive through github.
2) Edit the config.yml file.
3) Run the script.

THINGS I'D LIKE TO ADD IN THE FUTURE:
- Add option to use SSH keys to login to remote server
- Limit amount of backups kept in destination folder
- Add gzip compression to tar archive
- Better error handling
- Add a .gitignore
- Change config.yml to config.yml.example

LICENSE:
None. Use this however you wish and at your own discretion.
