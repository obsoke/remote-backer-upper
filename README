REMOTE-BACKER-UPPER

This is a simple script I wrote in order to back up the files and
databases on my VPS. 

This script has only been tested with Ruby 1.9.3.

REQUIREMENTS:
- net/ssh gem
- net/scp gem

USAGE:
1) Clone repo or download it as an archive through github.
2) Rename 'config.yml.example' to 'config.yml' and edit the file.
3) Run the script.

THINGS I'D LIKE TO ADD IN THE FUTURE:
- Add option to use SSH keys to login to remote server
- Limit amount of backups kept in destination folder
- Add gzip compression to tar archive
- Better error handling

LICENSE:
None. Use this however you wish and at your own discretion.
